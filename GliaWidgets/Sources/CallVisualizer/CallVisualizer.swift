/// Call Visualizer is a feature for operators to transfer their visitors from conventional communication methods,
/// such as a phone call, to Glia solution. The visitor needs to provide to the operator a visitor code,
/// which they will find in their app either via alert or embedded view. By telling the code to the operator, they can
/// initiate engagement with the visitor directly through the app.
///
/// Call Visualizer class facilitates everything related to this feature:
///  1. Requesting and displaying visitor code
///  2. Starting an engagement once the visitor code has been submitted by the operator
///  3. Handling engagement, featuring video calling, screen sharing, and much more in future.
