**What was solved?**

**Additional info:**

- [ ] Is the feature sufficiently tested? All tests fixed? Necessary unit, acceptance, snapshots added? Check that at least new public classes & methods are covered with unit tests
- [ ] Did you add logging beneficial for troubleshooting of customer issues?
- [ ] **Did you add new logging?** We would like the logging between platforms to be similar. Refer to **Logging from iOS SDKs** → **Things to consider for newly added logs** in Confluence for more information.
